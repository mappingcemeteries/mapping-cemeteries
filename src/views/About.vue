                  Brianna hails from Michigan but has called Queens home for
                  almost 13 years. She is a copy chief and copy editor by day
                  and a graduate student in the MA in Digital Humanities (DH)
                  program at the CUNY Graduate Center by night. Joining the DH
                  community has definitely been her best pandemic decision. And
                  buying more sweatpants. DH and sweatpants: the two best
                  pandemic decisions by far. Mapping Cemeteries brings together
                  her interests (some old and some new-found) in social justice,
                  memory studies, infrastructure, and mapping. The original idea
                  for the project was hers, but what the project has become is
                  so much more than she ever could have expected, and it is all
                  thanks to the creative and collaborative energy of the entire
                  team. As project manager, she has created a group space for
                  everyone’s internal communications and workflow needs, she
                  sets the meeting agendas and keeps notes during each meeting,
                  and she makes sure blockers are addressed and goals are met.
                  She is also responsible for the researching and data
                  collection of a cemetery that was redeveloped and turned into
                  a public park: City Hall Park.

                Lisa is a writer and producer, they are also a digital
                humanities student working toward their Master of Arts in the
                Digital Humanities at the Graduate Center of the City University
                of New York (CUNY). A life-long New Yorker, they were drawn to
                this project because of their love of New York City history and
                their fascination with how we choose to remember those who came
                before. How do we determine who “deserves” to be remembered?
                What do those remembrances look like? How have these
                remembrances changed over time? Their primary roles in this
                project were site design and testing. This included working with
                the developer on which platform to use and what frameworks to
                apply, creating best practices for the incorporation of digital
                assets, and testing the site as it was developed. Their
                secondary roles were in documentation and research.
                Documentation included tracking conversations during the
                development stage and encouraging the team away from scope
                creep. Research responsibilities included working on technical
                options and scholarly research on a set of war memorials within
                Manhattan.

                  Asma (ahs-ma) N. is a Brooklyn native, Digital Humanist, Black
                  feminist, and a graduate student at The Graduate Center, CUNY.
                  She uses audio/technology to discourse her broader
                  philosophical research interests in gender, social ontology,
                  and digital humanities to develop original content in public
                  scholarship. Asma cares about creatively transposing what’s
                  meta about experience into accessible language and technology
                  alike. Her other central topics include beauty politics,
                  digital space and identity, and sound studies — all in
                  relationship to Black women and individuals who are the
                  priority in her work. Asma has a strong background in research
                  and advocacy, having maintained a handful of fellowships
                  across reproductive health, leadership, and diplomacy during
                  and post undergrad at the University of Maryland, College
                  Park. She’s also held appointments as a coordinator of
                  education and training for diversity initiatives, and
                  educational data management in the sites of D.C./Maryland and
                  New York City. Asma is 1/5th of the team, Mapping Cemeteries,
                  which is a digital humanist timeline project that explores the
                  relationship between identity and death across four distinct
                  cemeteries in New York City. She contributes her research
                  skills in language, methodology, and analysis, as well as
                  project design, strategy, and audiovisual modulation. Most of
                  the above says more about her professional abilities and less
                  about who is Asma. Somewhere at the core are the matters of
                  the head and the heart that speak to love, wellness, and
                  Halloween (her favorite time of year).

                  lane vineyard is a first-year student at the CUNY Graduate
                  Center currently pursuing a master’s in Digital Humanities.
                  They currently hold a B.A. in Linguistics, with minors in
                  Spanish and Mandarin, from Middle Tennessee State University.
                  Though they have some educational background in the arts and
                  humanities, they have only recently begun delving into the
                  field of Digital Humanities. Their research interests include
                  queer culture and history, digital mapping tools, design, and
                  studying the intersection of language and identity with DH
                  tools. lane’s primary role for the project is outreach, which
                  entails the creation and maintenance of an online presence for
                  the project. Additionally, they do primary research for one of
                  the cemeteries showcased in the project, which is a cemetery
                  that was repurposed, rediscovered, and now exists again as
                  both a cemetery and national monument
