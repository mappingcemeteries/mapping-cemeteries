The city's first nonsectarian cemetery -- its 156 underground vaults were open to the wealthy of any faith -- was situated on a half-acre plot just west of Second Avenue between Second and Third streets.  An inscription blazoned on its east wall read PLACE OF BURIAL FOR GENTLEMEN.  It was so successful they opened a second one, a block east, in 1832.  Further annexes were ruled out the following year by the real estate boom, which drove the value of downtown lots to such heights that the City Council extended the ban on new interments north to 14th Street.

Norton & Company, 2015.",,,,,1826,New York Marble Cemetery as a profit-making venture: A look into racialized restrictions on voting in the city,"One aspect of the first days of the cemetery is how it was built as a profit-making venture. The early vaults were sold for 250$ at the time. I tried to put this into context within New York City’s abolition process at the time. Before 1821, in order to allow people to vote, New Yor City had a property restriction set for people to vote, in the sense where you need to own a specific amount of property to cast a ballot. During this time, New York was in the middle of a gradual abolition of slavery. However, after 1821, the property restrictions on voting became racialized. By that I mean that they were completely removed for white people and imposed on black people. So basically, the only way that the constitution allowed black people to vote is if they had $250 in property, which at that time was almost impossible. The numbers show that.. in 1826, only sixteen black men in the city were able to vote. And this did not change much in the time where the cemetery was founded. The fact that the vaults were also sold for $250 is very telling of the type of people that the “non-sectarian” cemetery aimed to cater for. It is safe to assume that the cemetery was built on exclusionary practices that excluded black people from being buried there and it will always carry that legacy",,Historical,,,,,"""Despite this burgeoning community life, the living conditions of black New Yorkers deteriorated. Even as gradual abolition proceeded, racism became more entrenched in the city’s culture. Before 1821, non-racial property restrictions determined which men could vote. But in that year, while eliminating property qualifications for whites, the state’s constitutional convention imposed a prohibitive $250 requirement for blacks. By 1826, only sixteen black men in the city were able to cast a ballot.""",,,,
