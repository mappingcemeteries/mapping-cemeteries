The city's first nonsectarian cemetery -- its 156 underground vaults were open to the wealthy of any faith -- was situated on a half-acre plot just west of Second Avenue between Second and Third streets.  An inscription blazoned on its east wall read PLACE OF BURIAL FOR GENTLEMEN.  It was so successful they opened a second one, a block east, in 1832.  Further annexes were ruled out the following year by the real estate boom, which drove the value of downtown lots to such heights that the City Council extended the ban on new interments north to 14th Street.

The most that can be said in opposition to this is that we are somewhat premature, perhaps half a century.  But what is half a century in the affairs of a nation like ours, thoroughly imbued with the progressive spirit. A mere point, which, like a point in mathematics, should not enter into the solution of the great problem.""",,Worth was prescient.  Over the course of the nineteenth century the country known as the United State of America expanded beyond its original colonial footprint to span the continent.,1872,1875,,1
