The subsequent data points about this Deathscape on film and media (The Mystery of Flying Kicks) give reference to each. However, death feels most unexplored in what’s discursive about Shoe-Hanging(s) and primary knowledge on this aspect may best live with residents of the City at this phase of the Mapping Cemeteries Timeline. 

This Deathscape undertakes the topic of death with this heavily in mind by contextualizing what is human and known about the social geography of Shoe-Hangings in the City; how experience is constitutive - or necessary - for what can be assumed and inferred about the material remains that are City Shoe-Hangings.

They, akin to street memorials (fixed with candles, imagery, and sentiments), can have multiple meanings, but experience is what feels humanistic, connective, and constant in a specific observation, but not a general one of them.

Though I spent my childhood and adolescence observing Shoe-Hangings (sometimes referred to as ‘shoe-tossing’), I hardly considered the potential overlap they share with hangings that are explicitly linked to death in the United States. African Slaves and non-enslaved poor folk of the City (and Country) are referenced by the African Burial Ground and City Hall Deathscapes of Mapping Cemeteries, and they help to name and chronologize this history of hangings as a function. 

The questions and connections about overlap are not attempts to conflate what is contextual with what is understood as historical. The contemplation of its display and its overlaps methodologically expand what is found in the processes of inquiry and observation to understand why other sources have not similarly remarked or acted upon them with more fervor in research discourses. 

Asking this is key to locating what’s granular about the practice as a whole. Shoe-Hangings in the context of death in the City would likely require an actor or agent who can toss or otherwise access the Powerlines to display and observe them. This appears diametric to what is historicized about hangings as an act, typically initiated by a body of power and its agents (white supremacy) upon subjugated social groups. 

Exploring these question are self-reflexive in tone, if not in nature, and it shaped subsequent questions such as: What happens when neither the state, or an actor of it, displays shoes as a memorial project? Does it become transgressive or subversive for how it repurposes space marauded by Power/lines?

Political projects appear when looking at the necropolitics of this Deathscape and its irresolutions. But the possibility of them should not distance or consume what else is outstandingly metaphysical and memorial about the display and observation of Shoe-Hangings in the public domain. Observation and academic inquiry, here, will hopefully bring us closer to what is overtly fungible about the belonging of shoes (or a similar relic) and what will remember or display us?

(2019). A Love Song for Latasha. ",,,,,"Uploaded April 15th, 2021 by Asma N.",Audio as a Mode of Mapping  ,"An ontological, or experiential appreciation of Shoe-Hangings was applied through an engagement of audio and visual resources that locate the human between the metaphysical borders of State/People and life/death. 

Both paradigms - State/People and life/death - are relational to Shoe-Hangings and what makes them necropolitical in one light, but it should not be conflated with narrative (and this emphasis will reverberate throughout the Deathscape). What may be narrative is unbound by time, physical geography, and legislature and this was reached in caucus with the Mapping Cemeteries team and project consultant, Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, Jesse Prinz, Ph.D on separate occasions.

Play, ephemera, emotion, and subjectivity are among the links that contextualize experience for this Deathscape and this approach materialized from said conversations. Although each category is not certain of the bodies connected to Shoe-Hangings, the deemphasis on power and its relationality (through play, ephemera, and so forth) allow us to see the human subject beyond its socialized conditioning and through what is affective, which connect us all in some way. 

This approach is best demonstrated by the directorial methods of Sophia Nahli Allison’s A Love Song for Latasha (2021), which is a film that reimagines the experience of Latasha Harlins. Harlins is often remembered as a 15-year-old Black girl killed in 1991 by the store owner of a shop she frequented in South Central Los Angles, CA. Allison approaches Harlin’s narrative through three observed methods: 
- Contextualization: family and friends speak about Harlin and her humanity as a playful, compassionate, and actualized person. Black children and girls are seen playing, the sun shines and smiles on their complexion, beads, and hair clips. 
- Time: parts of the documentary reverse literally, narratively, and metaphorically to Harlin’s childhood, which frames her subjectivity and not her death. 
- Audio: Allison uses sound to discuss the details of Harlin’s death.  Voiceover and a visual void appear to mirror the heat-sensitive screen behind our eyes. At times, Allison uses heat sensory illustrations, fast and imaginatively to visualize what’s unseen and felt about the memory of Harlin’s death. The viewer is guided by a single voice to what becomes spatial.

My methodological framework specifically consults Allison’s take on Context (language and images) and Audio as methods for Shoe-Hangings in the Mapping Cemeteries and its audio project, Mapping Cemeteries: After Life. 

After Life is a 3-part, limited series audio project that discusses our Timeline on the Deathscapes of New York City. Field recordings, which is a collection of sounds unique to a field (or region), and audio journals are used to facilitate episode two, “Our Deathscapes.” What would’ve ordinarily occurred in-studio for the vocal aspects transpired asynchronously and with the field of MC’s Deathscapes in mind to create an embodied, intimate, audio experience akin to what is heard and felt in Allison’s. Sound is also crucial to the ethics of documenting the Shoe-Hanging Deathscape, which is also discussed in the aforementioned episode.

Beloved is a ghost and as such she lives between the borders of the living and those who have passed on. The ways in which Beloved materializes is critical to understanding the sense of belonging mentioned because it’s how she may actualize herself. Experience is one of few examples - between life and death - that occupies a similar spatiality. Like Beloved, how we materialize this as humans beings is acutely the same for contextualizing Shoe-Hangings as a relic of human experience.

In another example, if one were to think literal, they might remember idioms about ‘walking in one’s shoes’ and what that could mean about the bodies metaphorically connected to them in terms of experience. Ellen Sampson, a material culture researcher, anthropologically understands shoes as “records of lived experience” for what they could indicate about the wearers experience (personalization, play) or existence (occupation, social role).

What remembers us in death, as this data point asks, often points to what we use or was used to instantiate our lived experience. Shoe-Hangings in the context of death memorializes the wearer. What will remember you?
