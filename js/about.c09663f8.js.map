A life-long New Yorker, they\n                  were drawn to this project because of their love of New York\n                  City history and their fascination with how we choose to\n                  remember those who came before. How do we determine who\n                  “deserves” to be remembered? What do those remembrances look\n                  like? How have these remembrances changed over time?

Their secondary roles were in documentation\n                  and research. Documentation included tracking conversations\n                  during the development stage and encouraging the team away\n                  from scope creep.

Asma cares about creatively transposing what’s\n                  meta about experience into accessible language and technology\n                  alike. Her other central topics include beauty politics,\n                  digital space and identity, and sound studies — all in\n                  relationship to Black women and individuals who are the\n                  priority in her work.

Asma is 1/5th of the team, Mapping Cemeteries,\n                  which is a digital humanist timeline project that explores the\n                  relationship between identity and death across four distinct\n                  cemeteries in New York City. She contributes her research\n                  skills in language, methodology, and analysis, as well as\n                  project design, strategy, and audiovisual modulation.
