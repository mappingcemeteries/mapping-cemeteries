This extends even beyond the African Burial Ground and raises myriad questions about the ethics and competency of urban development in the city in both a modern and historical sense. Of course, the sacred grounds were bulldozed over long before the excavation for the federal building in 1991; yet it highlights how the push for rapid city development without thorough analysis of historical aspects in tandem with the archaeological can easily and conveniently aid in active obscuration and desecration of sacred land, continually burying resting places under layers of concrete and brick. The pervasive and systemic nature of oppression in this country is elucidated in tragedies such as this, it’s evident that marginalization follows countless even in death. Moreover, the estimated 20,000 African descendants resting in the African Burial Ground were foundational in the construction of New York City, and now they lie trapped beneath a city which owes much of its success and grandeur to centuries of their forced labor, subjugation, and agentive erasure. \",\"Gravatar\":null,\"Tag One\":null,\"Tag Two\":\"Rediscovered \",\"Tag Three\":null,\"Tag Four\":null,\"SubTitle1\":\"Not much can be done to amend centuries worth of insurmountable damage and ruination of sacred spaces. Active initiatives to prevent further instances like this from occurring, however, would be a step in the right direction. Preliminary investigation for construction in New York City should entail detailed investigation into the history of the intended building site; this should occur prior to excavation. Referencing older maps of the city could reveal significant information, such as recorded burial sites or other types of sacred land. However, given the past actions of organizations like the GSA, it’s uncertain whether construction would ensue regardless of investigation outcomes. The racism that led to the initial devaluation of the African Burial Ground National Monument still prevails today, which further highlights the importance of the memorials such as the African Burial Ground. In a 2020 NPR interview with Michael Blakey, the principal investigator for analysis of the remains, the anthropologist commented on the role this memorial plays in present day: “Memorials are part of what it means to be human. And during slavery, the burial of the dead was very important - keenly important for Africans and African Americans whose humanity - it was very humanity was contested, as I suggested. There have been changes, for sure, in the last 200 years. But as we see in 2020, there have also been continuities of the disregard for Black lives. So these memorials and the African Burial Ground is a memorial that celebrates not just death but the sanctity of Black life and the importance of our history.\\\"\",\"SubText1\":null,\"SubTitle2\":null,\"SubText2\":null,\"SubTitle3\":null,\"SubText3\":null},{\"Name\":null,\"Custodian\":null,\"Caption\":null,\"Description\":null,\"Data

The seat of power built upon a space so preoccupied with punishing bodies; this inheritance seems more than symbolic. I have visited the park various times since moving to New York City 13 years ago. What struck me most on my visit for this project was how little I had paid attention before. Everything I thought I had “discovered” about the area was all laid out in a massive ground plaque near the south entrance.

The plaque strikes me as something that was a much better idea on paper than it is in reality. The surface is very slick and must be very hazardous to walk over in inclement weather. In addition, it is just not very easy to read. The large segment sizes and the curved lines already make the text hard to read; that the engraved letters and maps are filled with dirt, pigeon droppings, and other debris makes them that much harder to read. I spent the better part of 20 minutes trying to get through it all. It is both too much text and not enough. The period covered is too long for a plaque to provide any depth to the historical eras. And the particularly troubling aspects of the space have been carefully assigned to the Dutch (public executions) and British (starvation and execution of American prisoners of war). The inheritance is acknowledged, but only at a surface level (quite literally).\",\"SubTitle2\":null,\"SubText2\":\"I spent much of my visit then walking around the entirety of the park and examining City Hall from just about every angle. I experienced many complicated feelings. It is a beautiful building, made all the more picturesque by the magnolia trees in full bloom. But the police were ever-present, and there are barricades all around City Hall, keeping everyone from getting very close—the seat of government barricaded from the very people it represents. (It seems like these have been left up since last summer during the George Floyd protests and subsequent short-lived Occupy City Hall movement demanding the city defund the police.)\",\"SubTitle3\":null,\"SubText3\":\"Despite knowing which corner of the park held the cemetery marker I was here to visit, it took me a while to find it. It is technically part of the park, but it is outside the nicely manicured and ornately fenced part of the park, in a shabbier, small grassy area on Centre Street near Chambers Street. This marker is also light on details. These “fragmentary remains” were disturbed and reinterred here as the result of a 2010 renovation of the area, which has me wondering how many bodies were disturbed and disregarded in earlier renovations and construction projects in the space. Executed bodies, poor bodies, starved bodies, incarcerated bodies—bodies treated as a burden to the State in both life and death.

Names from the original vault owners are engraved on marble tablets that are set into the stone cemetery walls. These tablets act as a guide for the location of the vaults underground. In order to access a vault, a stone slab has to be exposed by digging by hand, that is then lifted off to expose the entry shaft going down to the slate doors.
