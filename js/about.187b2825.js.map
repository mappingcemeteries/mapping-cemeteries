Though American lynching was historically prevalent in Slavery and Jim Crow (and present day), it was also a method of execution for non-enslaved poor folk of the City and it is referenced by the City Hall Deathscape of Mapping Cemeteries.  Both Wells and the City Hall Deathscape help to frame what’s discursive about the history of hangings as a function and/or tool in America. \",\"Gravatar\":\"https://unsplash.com/photos/vDyhn5dM1wg?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditShareLink\",\"Tag One\":\"queens\",\"Tag Two\":\"embodiment\",\"Tag Three\":\"Hidden\",\"Tag Four\":null,\"SubTitle1\":null,\"SubText1\":\"The questions and connections about overlap are not attempts to conflate what is contextual with what is understood as historical.

A voiceover and a visual void appear to mirror the heat-sensitive screen behind our eyes.

This extends even beyond the African Burial Ground and raises myriad questions about the ethics and competency of urban development in the city in both a modern and historical sense. Of course, the sacred grounds were bulldozed over long before the excavation for the federal building in 1991; yet it highlights how the push for rapid city development without thorough analysis of historical aspects in tandem with the archaeological can easily and conveniently aid in active obscuration and desecration of sacred land, continually burying resting places under layers of concrete and brick. The pervasive and systemic nature of oppression in this country is elucidated in tragedies such as this, it’s evident that marginalization follows countless even in death. Moreover, the estimated 20,000 African descendants resting in the African Burial Ground were foundational in the construction of New York City, and now they lie trapped beneath a city which owes much of its success and grandeur to centuries of their forced labor, subjugation, and agentive erasure. \",\"Gravatar\":null,\"Tag One\":null,\"Tag Two\":\"Rediscovered \",\"Tag Three\":null,\"Tag Four\":null,\"SubTitle1\":null,\"SubText1\":\"Not much can be done to amend centuries worth of insurmountable damage and ruination of sacred spaces. Active initiatives to prevent further instances like this from occurring, however, would be a step in the right direction. Preliminary investigation for construction in New York City should entail detailed investigation into the history of the intended building site; this should occur prior to excavation. Referencing older maps of the city could reveal significant information, such as recorded burial sites or other types of sacred land. However, given the past actions of organizations like the GSA, it’s uncertain whether construction would ensue regardless of investigation outcomes. The racism that led to the initial devaluation of the African Burial Ground National Monument still prevails today, which further highlights the importance of the memorials such as the African Burial Ground. In a 2020 NPR interview with Michael Blakey, the principal investigator for analysis of the remains, the anthropologist commented on the role this memorial plays in present day: “Memorials are part of what it means to be human. And during slavery, the burial of the dead was very important - keenly important for Africans and African Americans whose humanity - it was very humanity was contested, as I suggested. There have been changes, for sure, in the last 200 years. But as we see in 2020, there have also been continuities of the disregard for Black lives. So these memorials and the African Burial Ground is a memorial that celebrates not just death but the sanctity of Black life and the importance of our history.\\\"\",\"SubTitle2\":null,\"SubText2\":null,\"SubTitle3\":null,\"SubText3\":null},{\"Name\":\"File:Hand-Carved Wooden Coffin from Ghana.jpg\",\"Custodian\":\"lane\",\"Caption\":\"Hand-carved wooden coffin from Ghana\",\"Description\":\"One of the hand-carved wooden coffins made in Ghana that is now buried in the African Burial Ground National Monument. \",\"Data type\":\"Photo\",\"Purpose\":\"Photo\",\"Attribution\":null,\"Source Link\":\"https://www.nps.gov/afbg/learn/historyculture/reinterment.htm#:~:text=The%20Rites%20of%20Ancestral%20Return%20commemorative%20ceremony%2C%20which%20began%20with,D.C.%2C%20to%20New%20York%20City\",\"Citation\":\"File:Hand-Carved Wooden Coffin from Ghana.jpg\",\"Institution\":\"Wikimedia Commons\",\"Image Link\":\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Hand-Carved_Wooden_Coffin_from_Ghana.jpg\",\"Longitude\":null,\"Latitude\":null,\"Date\":null,\"Title\":null,\"Text Box\":\"One of the hand-carved wooden coffins made in Ghana that is now buried in the African Burial Ground National Monument.  \",\"Gravatar\":null,\"Tag One\":\"African \",\"Tag Two\":\"Rediscovered\",\"Tag Three\":\"Repurposed\",\"Tag Four\":null,\"SubTitle1\":null,\"SubText1\":null,\"SubTitle2\":null,\"SubText2\":null,\"SubTitle3\":null,\"SubText3\":null}]","'use strict';\nvar ArrayBufferViewCore = require('../internals/array-buffer-view-core');\n\nvar aTypedArray = ArrayBufferViewCore.aTypedArray;\nvar exportTypedArrayMethod = ArrayBufferViewCore.exportTypedArrayMethod;\nvar $join = [].join;\n\n// `%TypedArray%.prototype.join` method\n// https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-%typedarray%.prototype.join\n// eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-vars -- required for `.length`\nexportTypedArrayMethod('join', function join(separator) {\n  return $join.apply(aTypedArray(this), arguments);\n});\n","// Styles\nimport './VItemGroup.sass'\n\n// Mixins\nimport Groupable from '../../mixins/groupable'\nimport Proxyable from '../../mixins/proxyable'\nimport Themeable from '../../mixins/themeable'\n\n// Utilities\nimport mixins from '../../util/mixins'\nimport { consoleWarn } from '../../util/console'\n\n// Types\nimport { VNode } from 'vue/types'\n\nexport type GroupableInstance = InstanceType<typeof Groupable> & {\n  id?: string\n  to?: any\n  value?: any\n }\n\nexport const BaseItemGroup = mixins(\n  Proxyable,\n  Themeable\n).extend({\n  name: 'base-item-group',\n\n  props: {\n    activeClass: {\n      type: String,\n      default: 'v-item--active',\n    },\n    mandatory: Boolean,\n    max: {\n      type: [Number, String],\n      default: null,\n    },\n    multiple: Boolean,\n    tag: {\n      type: String,\n      default: 'div',\n    },\n  },\n\n  data () {\n    return {\n      // As long as a value is defined, show it\n      // Otherwise, check if multiple\n      // to determine which default to provide\n      internalLazyValue: this.value !== undefined\n        ? this.value\n        : this.multiple ?

The remains found in the northeast corner were likely residents of the First Almshouse, though full analysis of the remains was not undertaken, nor was a full archaelogical excavation completed. In the locations where whole remains were found, the park renovations were altered such that the green spaces and walkways could be built over top of them without harming the sites. Fragmentary remains were also discovered in the park. These were sent to the Smithsonian Institution for further investigation. The fragementary remains were reinterred in 2010 in the northeast corner of the park, outside of the fenced-in area.\",\"SubTitle3\":null,\"SubText3\":null},{\"Name\":\"Eighth Card: My Reflections\",\"Custodian\":\"Bri\",\"Caption\":\"Commemorative plaque in City Hall Park, section of which reads \\\"Cradle of Liberty.\\\"\",\"Description\":\"Eighth card on City Hall Park page, with my reflections from visiting the site as part of this project\",\"Data type\":\"Text, Image\",\"Purpose\":\"Location page\",\"Attribution\":\"Photo taken by Brianna on April 10, 2021\",\"Source Link\":null,\"Citation\":null,\"Institution\":\"CUNY Commons\",\"Image Link\":\"https://mappingcemeteries.commons.gc.cuny.edu/wp-content/blogs.dir/16656/files/2021/05/cradle_of_liberty_squarecrop.jpg\",\"Longitude\":null,\"Latitude\":null,\"Date\":null,\"Title\":\"My Reflections: A Reluctant Inheritance\",\"Text Box\":\"All in all, my research has led me toward an understanding of the space that is now City Hall Park as a place imbued with a lot of death. The seat of power built upon a space so preoccupied with punishing bodies; this inheritance seems more than symbolic. I have visited the park various times since moving to New York City 13 years ago. What struck me most on my visit for this project was how little I had paid attention before. Everything I thought I had “discovered” about the area was all laid out in a massive ground plaque near the south entrance. The public executions, the jails, that City Hall and Tweed Courthouse occupy the places where the First and Second Almshouses stood, respectively.

The plaque strikes me as something that was a much better idea on paper than it is in reality. The surface is very slick and must be very hazardous to walk over in inclement weather. In addition, it is just not very easy to read. The large segment sizes and the curved lines already make the text hard to read; that the engraved letters and maps are filled with dirt, pigeon droppings, and other debris makes them that much harder to read. I spent the better part of 20 minutes trying to get through it all. It is both too much text and not enough. The period covered is too long for a plaque to provide any depth to the historical eras. And the particularly troubling aspects of the space have been carefully assigned to the Dutch (public executions) and British (starvation and execution of American prisoners of war) segments. The inheritance is acknowledged, but only at a surface level (quite literally).\",\"SubTitle2\":null,\"SubText2\":null,\"SubTitle3\":null,\"SubText3\":null},{\"Name\":\"Ninth Card: Reflections Continued\",\"Custodian\":\"Bri\",\"Caption\":\"Fragmentary remains marker with view of east side of City Hall.\",\"Description\":\"Ninth card on City Hall Park page, with my reflections from visiting the site as part of this project continued\",\"Data type\":\"Text, Image\",\"Purpose\":\"Location page\",\"Attribution\":\"Photo taken by Brianna on April 10, 2021\",\"Source Link\":null,\"Citation\":null,\"Institution\":\"CUNY Commons\",\"Image Link\":\"https://mappingcemeteries.commons.gc.cuny.edu/wp-content/blogs.dir/16656/files/2021/04/fragmentary_remains_city_hall.jpg\",\"Longitude\":null,\"Latitude\":null,\"Date\":null,\"Title\":\"My Reflections: Remembering to Forget\",\"Text Box\":\"I spent much of my visit then walking around the entirety of the park and examining City Hall from just about every angle.

But the police were ever-present, and there were barricades all around City Hall, keeping everyone from getting very close—the seat of government barricaded from the very people it represents.

This marker is also light on details. These “fragmentary remains” were disturbed and reinterred here as the result of 1999 and 2010 renovations of the area, which has me wondering how many bodies were disturbed and disregarded in earlier renovations and construction projects in the space. And the complete remains discovered during renovations aren't even marked or recognized in the park in any way.

The early vaults were sold for 250$ at the time. I tried to put this into context within New York City’s abolition process at the time. Before 1821, in order to allow people to vote, New Yor City had a property restriction set for people to vote, in the sense where you need to own a specific amount of property to cast a ballot. During this time, New York was in the middle of a gradual abolition of slavery. However, after 1821, the property restrictions on voting became racialized. By that I mean that they were completely removed for white people and imposed on black people. So basically, the only way that the constitution allowed black people to vote is if they had $250 in property, which at that time was almost impossible. The numbers show that.. in 1826, only sixteen black men in the city were able to vote. And this did not change much in the time where the cemetery was founded. The fact that the vaults were also sold for $250 is very telling of the type of people that the “non-sectarian” cemetery aimed to cater for. It is safe to assume that the cemetery was built on exclusionary practices that excluded black people from being buried there and it will always carry that legacy\",\"Gravatar\":null,\"Tag One\":\"Historical\",\"Tag Two\":null,\"Tag Three\":null,\"Tag Four\":null,\"SubTitle1\":null,\"SubText1\":\"\\\"Despite this burgeoning community life, the living conditions of black New Yorkers deteriorated. Even as gradual abolition proceeded, racism became more entrenched in the city’s culture. Before 1821, non-racial property restrictions determined which men could vote. But in that year, while eliminating property qualifications for whites, the state’s constitutional convention imposed a prohibitive $250 requirement for blacks.

She is a copy chief and copy editor by day\r\n                  and a graduate student in the Master of Arts in Digital\r\n                  Humanities program at the Graduate Center of the City\r\n                  University of New York (CUNY) by night. Mapping Cemeteries\r\n                  brings together her interests (some old and some new-found) in\r\n                  social justice, memory studies, infrastructure, and mapping.\r\n                  The original idea for the project was hers, but what the\r\n                  project has become is so much more than she ever could have\r\n                  expected, and it is all thanks to the creative and\r\n                  collaborative energy of the entire team. In her primary role\r\n                  as project manager, she has created a group space for\r\n                  everyone’s internal communications and workflow needs, she\r\n                  sets the meeting agendas and keeps notes during each meeting,\r\n                  and she makes sure blockers are addressed and goals are met.\r\n                  She manages the team's private group page and public site here\r\n                  on the CUNY Academic Commons. For this first phase of the\r\n                  project, she is also responsible for researching and\r\n                  maintaining the data on a cemetery that was redeveloped and\r\n                  turned into a public park: City Hall Park.\r\n                </v-card-text>\r\n              </v-card>\r\n            </v-col>\r\n            <v-col>\r\n              <v-card class=\"ml-1 mr-1\" color=\"#D3D3D3\">\r\n                <v-card-title>\r\n                  <span class=\"title font-weight-bold\">Lisa Kofod</span>\r\n                  <v-card-actions>\r\n                    <v-list-item class=\"grow\">\r\n                      <v-list-item-avatar color=\"grey darken-3\">\r\n                        <v-spacer></v-spacer>\r\n                        <v-img\r\n                          class=\"elevation-6\"\r\n                          style=\"border: 2px solid black\"\r\n                          alt=\"\"\r\n                          src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/War_Memorial_Swords_Shield_Close-Up.png\"\r\n                        ></v-img>\r\n                      </v-list-item-avatar>\r\n                    </v-list-item>\r\n                  </v-card-actions>\r\n                </v-card-title>\r\n\r\n                <v-card-text class=\"font-weight-light\">\r\n                  Lisa is a writer and producer; they are also a digital\r\n                  humanities student working toward their Master of Arts in the\r\n                  Digital Humanities at the Graduate Center of the City\r\n                  University of New York (CUNY). A lifelong New Yorker, they are\r\n                  drawn to this project because of their love of New York City\r\n                  history and their fascination with how we choose to remember\r\n                  those who came before. How do we determine who “deserves” to\r\n                  be remembered? What do those remembrances look like? How have\r\n                  these remembrances changed over time? Their primary roles in\r\n                  this project are site design and testing. This includes\r\n                  working with the developer on which platform to use and what\r\n                  frameworks to apply, creating best practices for the\r\n                  incorporation of digital assets, and testing the site as it\r\n                  was developed. Their secondary roles are in documentation and\r\n                  research. Documentation includes tracking conversations during\r\n                  the development stage and encouraging the team away from scope\r\n                  creep. Research responsibilities include working on technical\r\n                  options and scholarly research on a set of war memorials\r\n                  within Manhattan.\r\n                </v-card-text>\r\n              </v-card>\r\n            </v-col>\r\n            <v-col>\r\n              <v-card class=\"ml-1 mr-1\" color=\"#D3D3D3\">\r\n                <v-card-title>\r\n                  <span class=\"title font-weight-bold\">Asma N. </span>\r\n                  <v-spacer></v-spacer>\r\n                  <v-card-actions>\r\n                    <v-list-item class=\"grow\">\r\n                      <v-list-item-avatar color=\"grey darken-3\">\r\n                        <v-spacer></v-spacer>\r\n                        <v-img\r\n                          style=\"border: 2px solid black\"\r\n                          class=\"elevation-6\"\r\n                          alt=\"\"\r\n                          src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1606170300294-84f3213babe3?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1934&q=80\"\r\n                        ></v-img>\r\n                      </v-list-item-avatar>\r\n                    </v-list-item>\r\n                  </v-card-actions>\r\n                </v-card-title>\r\n\r\n                <v-card-text class=\"font-weight-light\">\r\n                  Asma (aahs-ma) N. is a Brooklyn native, Digital Humanist,\r\n                  Black feminist, and a graduate student at The Graduate Center,\r\n                  CUNY.
