The burial ground, estimated to have been active from the mid-1630's to mid-1700's, was forcibly abandoned and in turn lost to years of city expansion. That is until the sacred ground was rediscovered in 1991 by excavation workers during archaeological survey for the construction of a General Services Administration (GSA) office building located between Chambers and Reades Streets. Upon uncovering human remains 24 feet under the ground, construction was temporarily halted, and geographic investigation of the area including maps of early New York City confirmed the existence of the burial ground. According to a 1754 map of the city, the sacred grounds —which at the time were located outside city limits due to African descendants being forbidden to bury their dead in what had become New York City’s primary burial ground—were labeled “Negros Burial Ground.” ",,African ,Rediscovered,Repurposed,,,,,,,

Despite the magnitude of this discovery, the GSA almost immediately pushed for resumption of excavation, intending to exhume and preserve the remains before bulldozing over and further desecrating the burial ground, treating what has been described as “one of the most significant American archeological finds in the twentieth century” as a minor setback for their $300 million construction project. This was rightfully met with outrage by multitudes of people, particularly the African American community who called out the GSA’s lack of respect and poorly executed archeological research design which resulted in the irreparable damage of fully intact burials.  ",,African ,Rediscovered,,,"It was only after the community staged protests at the burial site in 1992 that the GSA extended the construction hiatus and supplied additional funding towards a more thorough archaeological excavation of the site and surrounding area. However, the GSA’s purportedly optimized archaeological assessment failed to consult with any African-descendants or archaeologists experienced in African diasporic research; this was met with further criticism, and due to the perseverance and steadfastness of a coalition of community members that were unwavering in their protest, the GSA ultimately transferred control to renowned anthropologist Michael Blakey and his team of students at Howard University, a historically black college in Washington D.C.",,,,,

During this period, an additional nine intact burials were uncovered during excavation for a new sidewalk near the initial discovery site. This additional discovery further illuminated just how expansive the site is beyond the preserved. As per Geographer at Large, “The Federal Building site is only one small corner of the original ABG, containing perhaps 450 graves. The remainder of the graves still lies, some disturbed and some undisturbed, underneath what are now streets, courthouses, office buildings, and retail stores in the City Hall/Financial District of Lower Manhattan.” ",,,,,,,,,,,

Fifth card - Reflection,lane,,Fifth card - 2 paragraphs,"Text, Image",Location Page ,,,,,,,,4/6/2021,Reflections,"Everyday thousands of New Yorkers are going about their daily lives unaware that hundreds upon hundreds of bodies lie beneath the pavement they walk upon, the parks where their children play, the buildings where they work. This extends even beyond the African Burial Ground and raises myriad questions about the ethics and competency of urban development in the city in both a modern and historical sense. Of course, the sacred grounds were bulldozed over long before the excavation for the federal building in 1991; yet it highlights how the push for rapid city development without thorough analysis of historical aspects in tandem with the archaeological can easily and conveniently aid in active obscuration and desecration of sacred land, continually burying resting places under layers of concrete and brick. The pervasive and systemic nature of oppression in this country is elucidated in tragedies such as this, it’s evident that marginalization follows countless even in death. Moreover, the estimated 20,000 African descendants resting in the African Burial Ground were foundational in the construction of New York City, and now they lie trapped beneath a city which owes much of its success and grandeur to centuries of their forced labor, subjugation, and agentive erasure. ",,,Rediscovered ,,,"Not much can be done to amend centuries worth of insurmountable damage and ruination of sacred spaces. Active initiatives to prevent further instances like this from occurring, however, would be a step in the right direction. Preliminary investigation for construction in New York City should entail detailed investigation into the history of the intended building site; this should occur prior to excavation. Referencing older maps of the city could reveal significant information, such as recorded burial sites or other types of sacred land. However, given the past actions of organizations like the GSA, it’s uncertain whether construction would ensue regardless of investigation outcomes. The racism that led to the initial devaluation of the African Burial Ground National Monument still prevails today, which further highlights the importance of the memorials such as the African Burial Ground. In a 2020 NPR interview with Michael Blakey, the principal investigator for analysis of the remains, the anthropologist commented on the role this memorial plays in present day: “Memorials are part of what it means to be human. And during slavery, the burial of the dead was very important - keenly important for Africans and African Americans whose humanity - it was very humanity was contested, as I suggested. There have been changes, for sure, in the last 200 years. But as we see in 2020, there have also been continuities of the disregard for Black lives. So these memorials and the African Burial Ground is a memorial that celebrates not just death but the sanctity of Black life and the importance of our history.""",,,,,
