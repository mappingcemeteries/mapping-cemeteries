First issued as an Oxford University Press paperback, Oxford University Press, 2000.",,,,,1830,,"""New York had banned burials south of Canal Street, and by 1830 several enterprising businessmen had opened New York Marble Cemetery as a profit-making venture.  The city's first nonsectarian cemetery -- its 156 underground vaults were open to the wealthy of any faith -- was situated on a half-acre plot just west of Second Avenue between Second and Third streets.  An inscription blazoned on its east wall read PLACE OF BURIAL FOR GENTLEMEN.  It was so successful they opened a second one, a block east, in 1832.  Further annexes were ruled out the following year by the real estate boom, which drove the value of downtown lots to such heights that the City Council extended the ban on new interments north to 14th Street.

New York Marble Cemetery vaults wall,Nadia,"The New York Marble Cemetery was created in response to the yellow fever outbreak that started near the Trinity Church cemetery. The Common Council ruled to ban earth graves in lower Manhattan to limit the spread of the Caribbean-born disease. Instead, marble vaults were built ten feet underground. Names from the original vault owners are engraved on marble tablets that are set into the stone cemetery walls. These tablets act as a guide for the location of the vaults underground. In order to access a vault, a stone slab has to be exposed by digging by hand, that is then lifted off to expose the entry shaft going down to the slate doors. Some of the vaults also require a key to open the door.",Color photo of a wall of vaults in the New York Marble Cemetery,Image,Vertical Timeline,,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/new-york-marble-cemetery,,Atlas Obscura,https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzL2VjOTc2MjNjLWQ5YTQtNDA3YS1iMmEyLThkZTM3OTY5YThiNzFhYjQwMGRjYmVmYjE5NGUzNl9OWV9NYXJibGVfQ2VtZXRlcnlfd2FsbF93aXRoX3ZhdWx0X3RhYmxldHNfMi5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjEyMDB4PiJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcXVhbGl0eSA4MSAtYXV0by1vcmllbnQiXV0/NY_Marble_Cemetery_wall_with_vault_tablets_2.jpg,,,1831,,,,Historical,,,,,,,,,

The cemetery is now but little hard and perhaps could be obtained of its owners at small expense and transformed into a playground. Burial there has always been in vault and the dead could be easily removed. The cemetery is a great garden surrounded by a high stone wall, and would seem to be well fitted for the establishment of a playground with gymnastic apparatus. The only school playground which New York has had her fire, is an old cemetery on the other side of Second avenue, near by, which has acquired under similar circumstances a few years ago, after it had ceased to be of use as a burial ground.",,,,,,,,,,,
