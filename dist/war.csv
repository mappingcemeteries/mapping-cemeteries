Located in Manhattan at the intersections of Broadway, Fifth Avenue and 25th Street, I was drawn to the site because I have lived and worked within walking distance of it for thirty-plus years but discovered (as part of my team’s initial research) that it is one of only two public memorials in New York City that contain the actual remains of the person.  [The second is President Grant’s Tomb in upper Manhattan.] ",,"Having ignored the site for so long, I spent an afternoon watching it and noticed that ignoring the monument was the dominant behavior of almost all the people who walked by it.  That experience led me to ask why?  What was it about the site made it almost disappear into the streetscape?  And why had the memory of the man himself seemingly faded from common knowledge?",,

but is dominated by the names of places where he fought, and these places are directly
tied to the expansion of the United States into Florida and Mexico in the mid-eighteen
hundreds.",,"Britannica, The Editors of Encyclopaedia. ""Arch of Constantine"". Encyclopedia Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/topic/Arch-of-Constantine. "
