What may be narrative is unbound by time, physical geography, and legislature and this was reached in caucus with the Mapping Cemeteries team and project consultant, Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, Jesse Prinz, Ph.D on separate occasions.\\n\\nPlay, ephemera, emotion, and subjectivity are among the links that contextualize experience for this Deathscape and this approach materialized from said conversations. Although each category is not certain of the bodies connected to Shoe-Hangings, the deemphasis on power and its relationality (through play, ephemera, and so forth) allow us to see the human subject beyond its socialized conditioning and through what is affective, which connect us all in some way. \\n\\nThis approach is best demonstrated by the directorial methods of Sophia Nahli Allison’s A Love Song for Latasha (2021), which is a film that reimagines the experience of Latasha Harlins. Harlins is often remembered as a 15-year-old Black girl killed in 1991 by the store owner of a shop she frequented in South Central Los Angles, CA. Allison approaches Harlin’s narrative through three observed methods: \\n- Contextualization: family and friends speak about Harlin and her humanity as a playful, compassionate, and actualized person. Black children and girls are seen playing, the sun shines and smiles on their complexion, beads, and hair clips. \\n- Time: parts of the documentary reverse literally, narratively, and metaphorically to Harlin’s childhood, which frames her subjectivity and not her death. \\n- Audio: Allison uses sound to discuss the details of Harlin’s death.  Voiceover and a visual void appear to mirror the heat-sensitive screen behind our eyes. At times, Allison uses heat sensory illustrations, fast and imaginatively to visualize what’s unseen and felt about the memory of Harlin’s death. The viewer is guided by a single voice to what becomes spatial.\\n\\nMy methodological framework specifically consults Allison’s take on Context (language and images) and Audio as methods for Shoe-Hangings in the Mapping Cemeteries and its audio project, Mapping Cemeteries: After Life. \\n\\nAfter Life is a 3-part, limited series audio project that discusses our Timeline on the Deathscapes of New York City. Field recordings, which is a collection of sounds unique to a field (or region), and audio journals are used to facilitate episode two, “Our Deathscapes.” What would’ve ordinarily occurred in-studio for the vocal aspects transpired asynchronously and with the field of MC’s Deathscapes in mind to create an embodied, intimate, audio experience akin to what is heard and felt in Allison’s. Sound is also crucial to the ethics of documenting the Shoe-Hanging Deathscape, which is also discussed in the aforementioned episode. \\n\\nTools:\\n- Field Recorder (Zoom H1n)\\n- Voice Memo (Apple/iOS)\\n- SoundCloud (RSS Feed)\\n- Digital Audio Workstation: Garageband, Audacity.\\n\\nConsultant: Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, Dr. Jesse Prinz.  \",\"Gravatar\":\"https://unsplash.com/photos/vDyhn5dM1wg?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditShareLink\",\"Tag One\":\"Powerlines\",\"Tag Two\":\"media\",\"Tag Three\":\"hidden\",\"Tag Four\":\"methods\",\"SubTitle1\":\"Discussing Embodied Methods for Shoe-Hangings \",\"SubText1\":null,\"SubTitle2\":null,\"SubText2\":null,\"SubTitle3\":null,\"SubText3\":null},{\"Name\":\"Training Day (2001), The Mystery of the Flying Kicks (2014).\",\"Custodian\":\"Asma\",\"Caption\":\"Shoe-hanging on the powerlines running across street intersection.

The ways in which Beloved materializes is critical to understanding the sense of belonging mentioned because it’s how she may actualize herself. Experience is one of few examples - between life and death - that occupies a similar spatiality. Like Beloved, how we materialize this as humans beings is acutely the same for contextualizing Shoe-Hangings as a relic of human experience.\\n\\nIn another example, if one were to think literal, they might remember idioms about ‘walking in one’s shoes’ and what that could mean about the bodies metaphorically connected to them in terms of experience. Ellen Sampson, a material culture researcher, anthropologically understands shoes as “records of lived experience” for what they could indicate about the wearers experience (personalization, play) or existence (occupation, social role).\\n\\nWhat remembers us in death, as this data point asks, often points to what we use or was used to instantiate our lived experience. Shoe-Hangings in the context of death memorializes the wearer.

Of course, the sacred grounds were bulldozed over long before the excavation for the federal building in 1991; yet it highlights how the push for rapid city development without thorough analysis of historical aspects in tandem with the archaeological can easily and conveniently aid in active obscuration and desecration of sacred land, continually burying resting places under layers of concrete and brick. The pervasive and systemic nature of oppression in this country is elucidated in tragedies such as this, it’s evident that marginalization follows countless even in death. Moreover, the estimated 20,000 African descendants resting in the African Burial Ground were foundational in the construction of New York City, and now they lie trapped beneath a city which owes much of its success and grandeur to centuries of their forced labor, subjugation, and agentive erasure. \",\"Gravatar\":null,\"Tag One\":null,\"Tag Two\":\"Rediscovered \",\"Tag Three\":null,\"Tag Four\":null,\"SubTitle1\":\"Not much can be done to amend centuries worth of insurmountable damage and ruination of sacred spaces. Active initiatives to prevent further instances like this from occurring, however, would be a step in the right direction. Preliminary investigation for construction in New York City should entail detailed investigation into the history of the intended building site; this should occur prior to excavation. Referencing older maps of the city could reveal significant information, such as recorded burial sites or other types of sacred land. However, given the past actions of organizations like the GSA, it’s uncertain whether construction would ensue regardless of investigation outcomes. The racism that led to the initial devaluation of the African Burial Ground National Monument still prevails today, which further highlights the importance of the memorials such as the African Burial Ground. In a 2020 NPR interview with Michael Blakey, the principal investigator for analysis of the remains, the anthropologist commented on the role this memorial plays in present day: “Memorials are part of what it means to be human. And during slavery, the burial of the dead was very important - keenly important for Africans and African Americans whose humanity - it was very humanity was contested, as I suggested. There have been changes, for sure, in the last 200 years. But as we see in 2020, there have also been continuities of the disregard for Black lives. So these memorials and the African Burial Ground is a memorial that celebrates not just death but the sanctity of Black life and the importance of our history.\\\"\",\"SubText1\":null,\"SubTitle2\":null,\"SubText2\":null,\"SubTitle3\":null,\"SubText3\":null},{\"Name\":null,\"Custodian\":null,\"Caption\":null,\"Description\":null,\"Data

In the locations where whole remains were found, the park renovations were altered such that the green spaces and walkways could be built over top of them without harming the sites.

What struck me most on my visit for this project was how little I had paid attention before. Everything I thought I had “discovered” about the area was all laid out in a massive ground plaque near the south entrance.

The plaque strikes me as something that was a much better idea on paper than it is in reality. The surface is very slick and must be very hazardous to walk over in inclement weather. In addition, it is just not very easy to read. The large segment sizes and the curved lines already make the text hard to read; that the engraved letters and maps are filled with dirt, pigeon droppings, and other debris makes them that much harder to read. I spent the better part of 20 minutes trying to get through it all. It is both too much text and not enough. The period covered is too long for a plaque to provide any depth to the historical eras. And the particularly troubling aspects of the space have been carefully assigned to the Dutch (public executions) and British (starvation and execution of American prisoners of war). The inheritance is acknowledged, but only at a surface level (quite literally).\",\"SubTitle2\":null,\"SubText2\":null,\"SubTitle3\":null,\"SubText3\":null},{\"Name\":\"Ninth Card: Reflections Continued\",\"Custodian\":\"Bri\",\"Caption\":\"Fragmentary remains marker with view of east side of City Hall.\",\"Description\":\"Ninth card on City Hall Park page, with my reflections from visiting the site as part of this project continued\",\"Data type\":\"Text, Image\",\"Purpose\":\"Location page\",\"Attribution\":\"Photo taken by Brianna April 10, 2021\",\"Source Link\":null,\"Citation\":null,\"Institution\":\"CUNY Commons\",\"Image Link\":\"https://mappingcemeteries.commons.gc.cuny.edu/wp-content/blogs.dir/16656/files/2021/04/fragmentary_remains_city_hall.jpg\",\"Longitude\":null,\"Latitude\":null,\"Date\":null,\"Title\":null,\"Text Box\":\"I spent much of my visit then walking around the entirety of the park and examining City Hall from just about every angle.

This marker is also light on details. These “fragmentary remains” were disturbed and reinterred here as the result of a 2010 renovation of the area, which has me wondering how many bodies were disturbed and disregarded in earlier renovations and construction projects in the space.

What may be narrative is unbound by time, physical geography, and legislature and this was reached in caucus with the Mapping Cemeteries team and project consultant, Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, Jesse Prinz, Ph.D on separate occasions.\\n\\nPlay, ephemera, emotion, and subjectivity are among the links that contextualize experience for this Deathscape and this approach materialized from said conversations. Although each category is not certain of the bodies connected to Shoe-Hangings, the deemphasis on power and its relationality (through play, ephemera, and so forth) allow us to see the human subject beyond its socialized conditioning and through what is affective, which connect us all in some way. \\n\\nThis approach is best demonstrated by the directorial methods of Sophia Nahli Allison�s A Love Song for Latasha (2021), which is a film that reimagines the experience of Latasha Harlins. Harlins is often remembered as a 15-year-old Black girl killed in 1991 by the store owner of a shop she frequented in South Central Los Angles, CA. Allison approaches Harlin�s narrative through three observed methods:?\\n- Contextualization: family and friends speak about Harlin and her humanity as a playful, compassionate, and actualized person. Black children and girls are seen playing, the sun shines and smiles on their complexion, beads, and hair clips.?\\n- Time: parts of the documentary reverse literally, narratively, and metaphorically to Harlin�s childhood, which frames her subjectivity and not her death.?\\n- Audio: Allison uses sound to discuss the details of Harlin�s death. Voiceover and a visual void appear to mirror the heat-sensitive screen behind our eyes. At times, Allison uses heat sensory illustrations, fast and imaginatively to visualize what�s unseen and felt about the memory of Harlin�s death. The viewer is guided by a single voice to what becomes spatial.\\n\\nMy methodological framework specifically consults Allison�s take on Context (language and images) and Audio as methods for Shoe-Hangings in the Mapping Cemeteries and its audio project, Mapping Cemeteries: After Life. \\n\\nAfter Life is a 3-part, limited series audio project that discusses our Timeline on the Deathscapes of New York City. Field recordings, which is a collection of sounds unique to a field (or region), and audio journals are used to facilitate episode two, �Our Deathscapes.� What would�ve ordinarily occurred in-studio for the vocal aspects transpired asynchronously and with the field of MC�s Deathscapes in mind to create an embodied, intimate, audio experience akin to what is heard and felt in Allison�s. Sound is also crucial to the ethics of documenting the Shoe-Hanging Deathscape, which is also discussed in the aforementioned episode. \\n\\nTools:\\n- Field Recorder (Zoom H1n)\\n- Voice Memo (Apple/iOS)\\n- SoundCloud (RSS Feed)\\n- Digital Audio Workstation: Garageband, Audacity.\\n\\nConsultant: Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, Dr. Jesse Prinz.\",\"Gravatar\":\"https://unsplash.com/photos/vDyhn5dM1wg?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditShareLink\",\"Tag One\":\"Powerlines\",\"Tag Two\":\"Media\",\"Tag Three\":\"Hidden\",\"Tag Four\":\"methods\",\"SubTitle1\":\"Discussing Embodied Methods for Shoe-Hangings\",\"SubText1\":null,\"SubTitle2\":null,\"SubText2\":null,\"SubTitle3\":null,\"SubText3\":null,\"Start\":2020,\"End\":2021,\"x\":null,\"y\":2,\"\":null},{\"Name\":\"2021 - A Love Song for Latasha (part 2)\",\"Custodian\":\"Asma\",\"Caption\":\"An image still from the 2020 film, A Love Song for Latasha (Allison).

The ways in which Beloved materializes is critical to understanding the sense of belonging mentioned because it�s how she may actualize herself. Experience is one of few examples - between life and death - that occupies a similar spatiality. Like Beloved, how we materialize this as humans beings is acutely the same for contextualizing Shoe-Hangings as a relic of human experience.\\n\\nIn another example, if one were to think literal, they might remember idioms about �walking in one�s shoes� and what that could mean about the bodies metaphorically connected to them in terms of experience. Ellen Sampson, a material culture researcher, anthropologically understands shoes as �records of lived experience� for what they could indicate about the wearers experience (personalization, play) or existence (occupation, social role).\\n\\nWhat remembers us in death, as this data point asks, often points to what we use or was used to instantiate our lived experience.

The early vaults were sold for 250$ at the time. I tried to put this into context within New York City’s abolition process at the time. Before 1821, in order to allow people to vote, New Yor City had a property restriction set for people to vote, in the sense where you need to own a specific amount of property to cast a ballot. During this time, New York was in the middle of a gradual abolition of slavery. However, after 1821, the property restrictions on voting became racialized. By that I mean that they were completely removed for white people and imposed on black people. So basically, the only way that the constitution allowed black people to vote is if they had 250$ in property, which at that time was almost impossible. The numbers show that.. in 1826, only sixteen black men in the city were able to vote. And this did not change much in the time where the cemetery was founded. The fact that the vaults were also sold for 250$ is very telling of the type of people that the “non-sectarian” cemetery aimed to cater for. It is safe to assume that the cemetery was built on exclusionary practices that excluded black people from being buried there and it will always carry that legacy\",\"Gravatar\":null,\"Tag One\":\"Historical\",\"Tag Two\":null,\"Tag Three\":null,\"Tag Four\":null,\"SubTitle1\":null,\"SubText1\":\"\\\"Despite this burgeoning community life, the living conditions of black New Yorkers deteriorated. Even as gradual abolition proceeded, racism became more entrenched in the city’s culture. Before 1821, non-racial property restrictions determined which men could vote. But in that year, while eliminating property qualifications for whites, the state’s constitutional convention imposed a prohibitive $250 requirement for blacks. By 1826, only sixteen black men in the city were able to cast a ballot.\\\"\",\"SubTitle2\":null,\"SubText2\":null,\"SubTitle3\":null,\"SubText3\":null},{\"Name\":null,\"Custodian\":null,\"Caption\":null,\"Description\":null,\"Data type\":null,\"Purpose\":null,\"Attribution\":null,\"Source Link\":null,\"Citation\":null,\"Institution\":null,\"Image Link\":null,\"Longitude\":null,\"Latitude\":null,\"Date\":1969,\"Title\":\"Historical New York Marble Cemetery Now\",\"Text Box\":\"In 1969, the cemetery became a New York City Landmark and 1980 it was placed in the National Register of Historic Places.\",\"Gravatar\":null,\"Tag One\":\"Historical\",\"Tag Two\":null,\"Tag Three\":null,\"Tag Four\":null,\"SubTitle1\":null,\"SubText1\":null,\"SubTitle2\":null,\"SubText2\":null,\"SubTitle3\":null,\"SubText3\":null}]","export * from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Park.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\"","// Styles\nimport './VListItem.sass'\n\n// Mixins\nimport Colorable from '../../mixins/colorable'\nimport Routable from '../../mixins/routable'\nimport { factory as GroupableFactory } from '../../mixins/groupable'\nimport Themeable from '../../mixins/themeable'\nimport { factory as ToggleableFactory } from '../../mixins/toggleable'\n\n// Directives\nimport Ripple from '../../directives/ripple'\n\n// Utilities\nimport { keyCodes } from './../../util/helpers'\nimport { ExtractVue } from './../../util/mixins'\nimport { removed } from '../../util/console'\n\n// Types\nimport mixins from '../../util/mixins'\nimport { VNode } from 'vue'\nimport { PropType, PropValidator } from 'vue/types/options'\n\nconst baseMixins = mixins(\n  Colorable,\n  Routable,\n  Themeable,\n  GroupableFactory('listItemGroup'),\n  ToggleableFactory('inputValue')\n)\n\ninterface options extends ExtractVue<typeof baseMixins> {\n  $el: HTMLElement\n  isInGroup: boolean\n  isInList: boolean\n  isInMenu: boolean\n  isInNav: boolean\n}\n\n/* @vue/component */\nexport default baseMixins.extend<options>().extend({\n  name: 'v-list-item',\n\n  directives: {\n    Ripple,\n  },\n\n  inject: {\n    isInGroup: {\n      default: false,\n    },\n    isInList: {\n      default: false,\n    },\n    isInMenu: {\n      default: false,\n    },\n    isInNav: {\n      default: false,\n    },\n  },\n\n  inheritAttrs: false,\n\n  props: {\n    activeClass: {\n      type: String,\n      default (): string | undefined {\n        if (!this.listItemGroup) return ''\n\n        return this.listItemGroup.activeClass\n      },\n    } as any as PropValidator<string>,\n    dense: Boolean,\n    inactive: Boolean,\n    link: Boolean,\n    selectable: {\n      type: Boolean,\n    },\n    tag: {\n      type: String,\n      default: 'div',\n    },\n    threeLine: Boolean,\n    twoLine: Boolean,\n    value: null as any as PropType<any>,\n  },\n\n  data: () => ({\n    proxyClass: 'v-list-item--active',\n  }),\n\n  computed: {\n    classes (): object {\n      return {\n        'v-list-item': true,\n        ...Routable.options.computed.classes.call(this),\n        'v-list-item--dense': this.dense,\n        'v-list-item--disabled': this.disabled,\n        'v-list-item--link': this.isClickable && !this.inactive,\n        'v-list-item--selectable': this.selectable,\n        'v-list-item--three-line': this.threeLine,\n        'v-list-item--two-line': this.twoLine,\n        ...this.themeClasses,\n      }\n    },\n    isClickable (): boolean {\n      return Boolean(\n        Routable.options.computed.isClickable.call(this) ||\n        this.listItemGroup\n      )\n    },\n  },\n\n  created () {\n    /* istanbul ignore next */\n    if (this.$attrs.hasOwnProperty('avatar')) {\n      removed('avatar', this)\n    }\n  },\n\n  methods: {\n    click (e: MouseEvent | KeyboardEvent) {\n      if (e.detail) this.$el.blur()\n\n      this.$emit('click', e)\n\n      this.to || this.toggle()\n    },\n    genAttrs () {\n      const attrs: Record<string, any> = {\n        'aria-disabled': this.disabled ? true : undefined,\n        tabindex: this.isClickable && !this.disabled ? 0 : -1,\n        ...this.$attrs,\n      }\n\n      if (this.$attrs.hasOwnProperty('role')) {\n        // do nothing, role already provided\n      } else if (this.isInNav) {\n        // do nothing, role is inherit\n      } else if (this.isInGroup) {\n        attrs.role = 'option'\n        attrs['aria-selected'] = String(this.isActive)\n      } else if (this.isInMenu) {\n        attrs.role = this.isClickable ?
