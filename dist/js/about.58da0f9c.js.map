Of course, the sacred grounds were bulldozed over long before the excavation for the federal building in 1991; yet it highlights how the push for rapid city development without thorough analysis of historical aspects in tandem with the archaeological can easily and conveniently aid in active obscuration and desecration of sacred land, continually burying resting places under layers of concrete and brick. The pervasive and systemic nature of oppression in this country is elucidated in tragedies such as this, it’s evident that marginalization follows countless even in death. Moreover, the estimated 20,000 African descendants resting in the African Burial Ground were foundational in the construction of New York City, and now they lie trapped beneath a city which owes much of its success and grandeur to centuries of their forced labor, subjugation, and agentive erasure. \",\"Gravatar\":null,\"Tag One\":null,\"Tag Two\":\"Rediscovered \",\"Tag Three\":null,\"Tag Four\":null,\"SubTitle1\":\"Not much can be done to amend centuries worth of insurmountable damage and ruination of sacred spaces. Active initiatives to prevent further instances like this from occurring, however, would be a step in the right direction. Preliminary investigation for construction in New York City should entail detailed investigation into the history of the intended building site; this should occur prior to excavation. Referencing older maps of the city could reveal significant information, such as recorded burial sites or other types of sacred land. However, given the past actions of organizations like the GSA, it’s uncertain whether construction would ensue regardless of investigation outcomes. The racism that led to the initial devaluation of the African Burial Ground National Monument still prevails today, which further highlights the importance of the memorials such as the African Burial Ground. In a 2020 NPR interview with Michael Blakey, the principal investigator for analysis of the remains, the anthropologist commented on the role this memorial plays in present day: “Memorials are part of what it means to be human. And during slavery, the burial of the dead was very important - keenly important for Africans and African Americans whose humanity - it was very humanity was contested, as I suggested. There have been changes, for sure, in the last 200 years. But as we see in 2020, there have also been continuities of the disregard for Black lives. So these memorials and the African Burial Ground is a memorial that celebrates not just death but the sanctity of Black life and the importance of our history.\\\"\",\"SubText1\":null,\"SubTitle2\":null,\"SubText2\":null,\"SubTitle3\":null,\"SubText3\":null},{\"Name\":null,\"Custodian\":null,\"Caption\":null,\"Description\":null,\"Data

The remains found in the northeast corner were likely residents of the First Almshouse, though full analysis of the remains was not undertaken, nor was a full archaelogical excavation completed. In the locations where whole remains were found, the park renovations were altered such that the green spaces and walkways could be built over top of them without harming the sites.

What struck me most on my visit for this project was how little I had paid attention before. Everything I thought I had “discovered” about the area was all laid out in a massive ground plaque near the south entrance.

The plaque strikes me as something that was a much better idea on paper than it is in reality. The surface is very slick and must be very hazardous to walk over in inclement weather. In addition, it is just not very easy to read. The large segment sizes and the curved lines already make the text hard to read; that the engraved letters and maps are filled with dirt, pigeon droppings, and other debris makes them that much harder to read. I spent the better part of 20 minutes trying to get through it all. It is both too much text and not enough. The period covered is too long for a plaque to provide any depth to the historical eras. And the particularly troubling aspects of the space have been carefully assigned to the Dutch (public executions) and British (starvation and execution of American prisoners of war). The inheritance is acknowledged, but only at a surface level (quite literally).\",\"SubTitle2\":null,\"SubText2\":null,\"SubTitle3\":null,\"SubText3\":null},{\"Name\":\"Ninth Card: Reflections Continued\",\"Custodian\":\"Bri\",\"Caption\":\"Fragmentary remains marker with view of east side of City Hall.\",\"Description\":\"Ninth card on City Hall Park page, with my reflections from visiting the site as part of this project continued\",\"Data type\":\"Text, Image\",\"Purpose\":\"Location page\",\"Attribution\":\"Photo taken by Brianna April 10, 2021\",\"Source Link\":null,\"Citation\":null,\"Institution\":\"CUNY Commons\",\"Image Link\":\"https://mappingcemeteries.commons.gc.cuny.edu/wp-content/blogs.dir/16656/files/2021/04/fragmentary_remains_city_hall.jpg\",\"Longitude\":null,\"Latitude\":null,\"Date\":null,\"Title\":null,\"Text Box\":\"I spent much of my visit then walking around the entirety of the park and examining City Hall from just about every angle.

This marker is also light on details. These “fragmentary remains” were disturbed and reinterred here as the result of a 2010 renovation of the area, which has me wondering how many bodies were disturbed and disregarded in earlier renovations and construction projects in the space.

The Common Council ruled to ban earth graves in lower Manhattan to limit the spread of the Caribbean-born disease. Instead, marble vaults were built ten feet underground. Names from the original vault owners are engraved on marble tablets that are set into the stone cemetery walls. These tablets act as a guide for the location of the vaults underground. In order to access a vault, a stone slab has to be exposed by digging by hand, that is then lifted off to expose the entry shaft going down to the slate doors. Some of the vaults also require a key to open the door.\",\"Description\":\"Color photo of a wall of vaults in the New York Marble Cemetery\",\"Data type\":\"Image\",\"Purpose\":\"Vertical Timeline\",\"Attribution\":null,\"Source Link\":\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/new-york-marble-cemetery\",\"Citation\":null,\"Institution\":\"Atlas Obscura\",\"Image Link\":\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzL2VjOTc2MjNjLWQ5YTQtNDA3YS1iMmEyLThkZTM3OTY5YThiNzFhYjQwMGRjYmVmYjE5NGUzNl9OWV9NYXJibGVfQ2VtZXRlcnlfd2FsbF93aXRoX3ZhdWx0X3RhYmxldHNfMi5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjEyMDB4PiJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcXVhbGl0eSA4MSAtYXV0by1vcmllbnQiXV0/NY_Marble_Cemetery_wall_with_vault_tablets_2.jpg\",\"Longitude\":null,\"Latitude\":null,\"Date\":1831,\"Title\":null,\"Text Box\":null,\"Gravatar\":null,\"Tag One\":\"Historical\",\"Tag Two\":null,\"Tag Three\":null,\"Tag Four\":null,\"SubTitle1\":null,\"SubText1\":null,\"SubTitle2\":null,\"SubText2\":null,\"SubTitle3\":null,\"SubText3\":null},{\"Name\":\"Image of broken memorial urn in the Marble Cemetery \",\"Custodian\":\"Nadia\",\"Caption\":null,\"Description\":\"Image broken memorial urn in the Marble Cemetery in the center of the block bound by 2nd Avenue, 2nd Street, 3rd Street and Bowery--proposed for use as a playground.\",\"Data type\":\"Image\",\"Purpose\":null,\"Attribution\":null,\"Source Link\":\"https://books.google.com/books?id=3SZZJD4zM88C&pg=RA1-PA14&lpg=RA1-PA14&dq=marble+cemetery+proposed+for+use+as+playground&source=bl&ots=G_a8A9fBn2&sig=ACfU3U3nc9STOasPjbCq9nUpERI1SU-ZIQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwinrafQlIHwAhUPKFkFHepRBFYQ6AEwCXoECBEQAw#v=onepage&q&f=false\",\"Citation\":\"Jacob A.

The early vaults were sold for 250$ at the time. I tried to put this into context within New York City’s abolition process at the time. Before 1821, in order to allow people to vote, New Yor City had a property restriction set for people to vote, in the sense where you need to own a specific amount of property to cast a ballot. During this time, New York was in the middle of a gradual abolition of slavery. However, after 1821, the property restrictions on voting became racialized. By that I mean that they were completely removed for white people and imposed on black people. So basically, the only way that the constitution allowed black people to vote is if they had 250$ in property, which at that time was almost impossible. The numbers show that.. in 1826, only sixteen black men in the city were able to vote. And this did not change much in the time where the cemetery was founded. The fact that the vaults were also sold for 250$ is very telling of the type of people that the “non-sectarian” cemetery aimed to cater for. It is safe to assume that the cemetery was built on exclusionary practices that excluded black people from being buried there and it will always carry that legacy\",\"Gravatar\":null,\"Tag One\":\"Historical\",\"Tag Two\":null,\"Tag Three\":null,\"Tag Four\":null,\"SubTitle1\":null,\"SubText1\":\"\\\"Despite this burgeoning community life, the living conditions of black New Yorkers deteriorated. Even as gradual abolition proceeded, racism became more entrenched in the city’s culture. Before 1821, non-racial property restrictions determined which men could vote. But in that year, while eliminating property qualifications for whites, the state’s constitutional convention imposed a prohibitive $250 requirement for blacks. By 1826, only sixteen black men in the city were able to cast a ballot.\\\"\",\"SubTitle2\":null,\"SubText2\":null,\"SubTitle3\":null,\"SubText3\":null},{\"Name\":null,\"Custodian\":null,\"Caption\":null,\"Description\":null,\"Data type\":null,\"Purpose\":null,\"Attribution\":null,\"Source Link\":null,\"Citation\":null,\"Institution\":null,\"Image Link\":null,\"Longitude\":null,\"Latitude\":null,\"Date\":1969,\"Title\":\"Historical New York Marble Cemetery Now\",\"Text Box\":\"In 1969, the cemetery became a New York City Landmark and 1980 it was placed in the National Register of Historic Places.\",\"Gravatar\":null,\"Tag One\":\"Historical\",\"Tag Two\":null,\"Tag Three\":null,\"Tag Four\":null,\"SubTitle1\":null,\"SubText1\":null,\"SubTitle2\":null,\"SubText2\":null,\"SubTitle3\":null,\"SubText3\":null}]","export * from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Park.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\"","// Styles\nimport './VListItem.sass'\n\n// Mixins\nimport Colorable from '../../mixins/colorable'\nimport Routable from '../../mixins/routable'\nimport { factory as GroupableFactory } from '../../mixins/groupable'\nimport Themeable from '../../mixins/themeable'\nimport { factory as ToggleableFactory } from '../../mixins/toggleable'\n\n// Directives\nimport Ripple from '../../directives/ripple'\n\n// Utilities\nimport { keyCodes } from './../../util/helpers'\nimport { ExtractVue } from './../../util/mixins'\nimport { removed } from '../../util/console'\n\n// Types\nimport mixins from '../../util/mixins'\nimport { VNode } from 'vue'\nimport { PropType, PropValidator } from 'vue/types/options'\n\nconst baseMixins = mixins(\n  Colorable,\n  Routable,\n  Themeable,\n  GroupableFactory('listItemGroup'),\n  ToggleableFactory('inputValue')\n)\n\ninterface options extends ExtractVue<typeof baseMixins> {\n  $el: HTMLElement\n  isInGroup: boolean\n  isInList: boolean\n  isInMenu: boolean\n  isInNav: boolean\n}\n\n/* @vue/component */\nexport default baseMixins.extend<options>().extend({\n  name: 'v-list-item',\n\n  directives: {\n    Ripple,\n  },\n\n  inject: {\n    isInGroup: {\n      default: false,\n    },\n    isInList: {\n      default: false,\n    },\n    isInMenu: {\n      default: false,\n    },\n    isInNav: {\n      default: false,\n    },\n  },\n\n  inheritAttrs: false,\n\n  props: {\n    activeClass: {\n      type: String,\n      default (): string | undefined {\n        if (!this.listItemGroup) return ''\n\n        return this.listItemGroup.activeClass\n      },\n    } as any as PropValidator<string>,\n    dense: Boolean,\n    inactive: Boolean,\n    link: Boolean,\n    selectable: {\n      type: Boolean,\n    },\n    tag: {\n      type: String,\n      default: 'div',\n    },\n    threeLine: Boolean,\n    twoLine: Boolean,\n    value: null as any as PropType<any>,\n  },\n\n  data: () => ({\n    proxyClass: 'v-list-item--active',\n  }),\n\n  computed: {\n    classes (): object {\n      return {\n        'v-list-item': true,\n        ...Routable.options.computed.classes.call(this),\n        'v-list-item--dense': this.dense,\n        'v-list-item--disabled': this.disabled,\n        'v-list-item--link': this.isClickable && !this.inactive,\n        'v-list-item--selectable': this.selectable,\n        'v-list-item--three-line': this.threeLine,\n        'v-list-item--two-line': this.twoLine,\n        ...this.themeClasses,\n      }\n    },\n    isClickable (): boolean {\n      return Boolean(\n        Routable.options.computed.isClickable.call(this) ||\n        this.listItemGroup\n      )\n    },\n  },\n\n  created () {\n    /* istanbul ignore next */\n    if (this.$attrs.hasOwnProperty('avatar')) {\n      removed('avatar', this)\n    }\n  },\n\n  methods: {\n    click (e: MouseEvent | KeyboardEvent) {\n      if (e.detail) this.$el.blur()\n\n      this.$emit('click', e)\n\n      this.to || this.toggle()\n    },\n    genAttrs () {\n      const attrs: Record<string, any> = {\n        'aria-disabled': this.disabled ? true : undefined,\n        tabindex: this.isClickable && !this.disabled ? 0 : -1,\n        ...this.$attrs,\n      }\n\n      if (this.$attrs.hasOwnProperty('role')) {\n        // do nothing, role already provided\n      } else if (this.isInNav) {\n        // do nothing, role is inherit\n      } else if (this.isInGroup) {\n        attrs.role = 'option'\n        attrs['aria-selected'] = String(this.isActive)\n      } else if (this.isInMenu) {\n        attrs.role = this.isClickable ?
