A life-long New Yorker, they\n                  were drawn to this project because of their love of New York\n                  City history and their fascination with how we choose to\n                  remember those who came before. How do we determine who\n                  “deserves” to be remembered? What do those remembrances look\n                  like? How have these remembrances changed over time? Their\n                  primary roles in this project were site design and testing.\n                  This included working with the developer on which platform to\n                  use and what frameworks to apply, creating best practices for\n                  the incorporation of digital assets, and testing the site as\n                  it was developed. Their secondary roles were in documentation\n                  and research. Documentation included tracking conversations\n                  during the development stage and encouraging the team away\n                  from scope creep. Research responsibilities included working\n                  on technical options and scholarly research on a set of war\n                  memorials within Manhattan.\n                </v-card-text>\n              </v-card>\n            </v-col>\n            <v-col>\n              <v-card class=\"ml-1 mr-1\" height=\"100vh\" color=\"#D3D3D3\">\n                <v-card-title>\n                  <span class=\"title font-weight-bold\">Asma N. </span>\n                  <v-spacer></v-spacer>\n                  <v-card-actions>\n                    <v-list-item class=\"grow\">\n                      <v-list-item-avatar color=\"grey darken-3\">\n                        <v-spacer></v-spacer>\n                        <v-img\n                          class=\"elevation-6\"\n                          alt=\"\"\n                          src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1606170300294-84f3213babe3?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1934&q=80\"\n                        ></v-img>\n                      </v-list-item-avatar>\n                    </v-list-item>\n                  </v-card-actions>\n                </v-card-title>\n\n                <v-card-text class=\"font-weight-light\">\n                  Asma (ahs-ma) N. is a Brooklyn native, Digital Humanist, Black\n                  feminist, and a graduate student at The Graduate Center, CUNY.\n                  She uses audio/technology to discourse her broader\n                  philosophical research interests in gender, social ontology,\n                  and digital humanities to develop original content in public\n                  scholarship. Asma cares about creatively transposing what’s\n                  meta about experience into accessible language and technology\n                  alike. Her other central topics include beauty politics,\n                  digital space and identity, and sound studies — all in\n                  relationship to Black women and individuals who are the\n                  priority in her work. Asma has a strong background in research\n                  and advocacy, having maintained a handful of fellowships\n                  across reproductive health, leadership, and diplomacy during\n                  and post undergrad at the University of Maryland, College\n                  Park. She’s also held appointments as a coordinator of\n                  education and training for diversity initiatives, and\n                  educational data management in the sites of D.C./Maryland and\n                  New York City. Asma is 1/5th of the team, Mapping Cemeteries,\n                  which is a digital humanist timeline project that explores the\n                  relationship between identity and death across four distinct\n                  cemeteries in New York City. She contributes her research\n                  skills in language, methodology, and analysis, as well as\n                  project design, strategy, and audiovisual modulation. Most of\n                  the above says more about her professional abilities and less\n                  about who is Asma.
