An inscription blazoned on its east wall read PLACE OF BURIAL FOR GENTLEMEN.  It was so successful they opened a second one, a block east, in 1832.

(2019). A Love Song for Latasha. ",,,,,2021,Audio as a Mode of Mapping,"An ontological, or experiential appreciation of Shoe-Hangings was applied through an engagement of audio and visual resources that locate the human between the metaphysical borders of State/People and life/death. 

Both paradigms - State/People and life/death - are relational to Shoe-Hangings and what makes them necropolitical in one light, but it should not be conflated with narrative (and this emphasis will reverberate throughout the Deathscape). What may be narrative is unbound by time, physical geography, and legislature and this was reached in caucus with the Mapping Cemeteries team and project consultant, Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, Jesse Prinz, Ph.D on separate occasions.

Play, ephemera, emotion, and subjectivity are among the links that contextualize experience for this Deathscape and this approach materialized from said conversations. Although each category is not certain of the bodies connected to Shoe-Hangings, the deemphasis on power and its relationality (through play, ephemera, and so forth) allow us to see the human subject beyond its socialized conditioning and through what is affective, which connect us all in some way. 

This approach is best demonstrated by the directorial methods of Sophia Nahli Allisonís A Love Song for Latasha (2021), which is a film that reimagines the experience of Latasha Harlins. Harlins is often remembered as a 15-year-old Black girl killed in 1991 by the store owner of a shop she frequented in South Central Los Angles, CA. Allison approaches Harlinís narrative through three observed methods:?
- Contextualization: family and friends speak about Harlin and her humanity as a playful, compassionate, and actualized person. Black children and girls are seen playing, the sun shines and smiles on their complexion, beads, and hair clips.?
- Time: parts of the documentary reverse literally, narratively, and metaphorically to Harlinís childhood, which frames her subjectivity and not her death.?
- Audio: Allison uses sound to discuss the details of Harlinís death. Voiceover and a visual void appear to mirror the heat-sensitive screen behind our eyes. At times, Allison uses heat sensory illustrations, fast and imaginatively to visualize whatís unseen and felt about the memory of Harlinís death. The viewer is guided by a single voice to what becomes spatial.

My methodological framework specifically consults Allisonís take on Context (language and images) and Audio as methods for Shoe-Hangings in the Mapping Cemeteries and its audio project, Mapping Cemeteries: After Life. 

After Life is a 3-part, limited series audio project that discusses our Timeline on the Deathscapes of New York City. Field recordings, which is a collection of sounds unique to a field (or region), and audio journals are used to facilitate episode two, ìOur Deathscapes.î What wouldíve ordinarily occurred in-studio for the vocal aspects transpired asynchronously and with the field of MCís Deathscapes in mind to create an embodied, intimate, audio experience akin to what is heard and felt in Allisonís. Sound is also crucial to the ethics of documenting the Shoe-Hanging Deathscape, which is also discussed in the aforementioned episode.

Beloved is a ghost and as such she lives between the borders of the living and those who have passed on. The ways in which Beloved materializes is critical to understanding the sense of belonging mentioned because itís how she may actualize herself. Experience is one of few examples - between life and death - that occupies a similar spatiality. Like Beloved, how we materialize this as humans beings is acutely the same for contextualizing Shoe-Hangings as a relic of human experience.

In another example, if one were to think literal, they might remember idioms about ëwalking in oneís shoesí and what that could mean about the bodies metaphorically connected to them in terms of experience. Ellen Sampson, a material culture researcher, anthropologically understands shoes as ìrecords of lived experienceî for what they could indicate about the wearers experience (personalization, play) or existence (occupation, social role).

What remembers us in death, as this data point asks, often points to what we use or was used to instantiate our lived experience. Shoe-Hangings in the context of death memorializes the wearer. What will remember you?
