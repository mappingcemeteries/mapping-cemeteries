Fifth Avenue and 25th Street, I was drawn to this site because I
have lived and worked within walking distance of it for thirty-plus years but
discovered (as part of our team’s initial research) that it is one of only two
public memorials in New York City that contain the actual remains of the
person.  [The second is President Grant’s
Tomb in upper Manhattan.]  ",,"Having ignored the site for so long, I spent an afternoon watching it and noticed that ignoring the monument was the dominant behavior of almost all the people who passed by.  ",,That experience led me to ask why? What was it about the site made it almost disappear into the streetscape? And why had the memory of the man himself seemingly faded from common knowledge?

but is dominated by the names of places where he fought, and these places are directly
tied to the expansion of the United States into Florida and Mexico in the mid-1800."

I began to wonder why this monument, housed on what is arguably some of the most valuable real estate in the world, had been permitted to remain?",The answer presented itself in one word: water. ,"As New York grew, so did its people’s thirst.  The local water sources were not enough, and by the early 1800s, plans to funnel water from Westchester and later the Catskills, had been developed.  The city dug deep tunnels in the bedrock to bring fresh water into the five boroughs. ",,"To save time and money, the land used to dig the Catskill water tunnels was almost completely owned by the City.  There were fourteen shafts sunk on Manhattan island and the shaft that serves the area around Madison Park is right under the Worth Monument!"
