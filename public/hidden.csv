",City Shoe-Hangings,"‘Shoe-Hanging’ is understood as a physical and notional human practice that can - observationally - represent group affiliation, mysticism, and geography. The subsequent data points on film as it concerns this Deathscape on (The Mystery of Flying Kicks) give reference to each. However, death feels most unexplored in what’s discursive about Shoe-Hanging(s) and primary knowledge on it may best live with residents of the City at this phase of the Mapping Cemeteries Timeline. 

This Deathscape undertakes the topic of death with this heavily in mind by contextualizing what is human and known about the social geography of Shoe-Hangings in the City; how experience is constitutive, or necessary, for what can be assumed and inferred about the material remains that are City Shoe-Hangings.

They, akin to street memorials (fixed with candles, imagery) can have multiple meanings. Experience is what feels humanistic, connective, and constant in a specific category (death), but not a general one of Shoe-Hangings.

Though I spent my childhood and adolescence observing Shoe-Hangings (sometimes referred to as ‘shoe-tossings’), I hardly considered the potential overlap they share with hangings that are explicitly linked to death in the United States. The pioneering Paula Giddings, Ph.D writes about the anti-lynching legacy of journalist, Ida B. Wells, who dedicated her career to unveiling and challenging the horrors of the American West such as lynching.  Though American lynching was historically prevalent in Slavery and Jim Crow (and present day), it was also a method of execution for non-enslaved poor folk of the City and it is referenced by the City Hall Deathscape of Mapping Cemeteries.  Both Wells and the City Hall Deathscape help to frame what’s discursive about the history of hangings as a function and/or tool in America. ",https://unsplash.com/photos/vDyhn5dM1wg?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditShareLink,queens,embodiment,Hidden,,,"The questions and connections about overlap are not attempts to conflate what is contextual with what is understood as historical. However niche, the display that is Shoe-Hangings (which lends to its aforementioned overlaps within American history) made me question why other sources have not similarly remarked; or emboldened them in research (if similar) to probe for a connection at all.

Shoe-Hangings in the context of death in the City would likely require an actor or agent who can toss or otherwise access the Powerlines to display them. This appears diametric to what is historicized about hangings as an act that is typically initiated by a body of power (white supremacy) or its agents upon people of subjugated social groups. ",,"Exploring this question and fidning this observation shaped subsequent questions such as: What happens when neither the state, or an actor of it, displays shoes as a memorial project? Does it become transgressive or subversive for how it repurposes space marauded by Power/lines?

Political projects appear when looking at the necropolitics of this Deathscape and its irresolutions. But the possibility of them should not distance or consume what else is outstandingly metaphysical and memorial about the display and observation of Shoe-Hangings in the public domain. Observation and academic inquiry, here, will hopefully bring us closer to what is overtly fungible about the belonging of shoes (or a similar relic) to a person. ",,
2021 - A Love Song for Latasha (part 1),Asma,"Sneakers tied at the laces on Powerline, with its location ""South Central Los Angles, CA"" inscribed in the center. 'Shoe-Hangings' are commonly found on Powerlines, tied at the laces and interspersed throughout specific regions of New York City (the latter of which usually has overlap(s) in characteristics of class and it may be essential to their appearances). Shoe-Hangings that appear on Powerlines are unfixed coordinates of space that can be arbitrated by the local City government. They are also arbitrated by the people who belonged to or were near the person behind those shoes (in the context of death).","A pair of shoes hanging on the powerlines with its location ""South Central Los Angles, CA"" inscribed in the center.

Both paradigms are relational to Shoe-Hangings and what makes them necropolitical in one light, but it should not be conflated with narrative (and this emphasis will reverberate throughout the Deathscape). What may be narrative is unbound by time, physical geography, and legislature and this was reached in caucus with the Mapping Cemeteries team and project consultant, Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, Jesse Prinz, Ph.D on separate occasions.",https://unsplash.com/photos/vDyhn5dM1wg?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditShareLink,Hidden,Power,,,Discussing Embodied Methods for Shoe-Hangings ,"Elements such as play, ephemera, and emotion are among the items that contextualize experience for this Deathscape and this approach materialized from said conversations. Although each category is not certain of or entirely applicable to the bodies connected to Shoe-Hangings, the deemphasis on power and its relationality (through play, ephemera, and so forth) allow us to see the human subject beyond its socialized conditioning and through what is affective or humanizing, and both have the ability to connect us (site viewers) through our humanity. 

This approach is best demonstrated by the directorial methods of Sophia Nahli Allison’s A Love Song for Latasha (2021), which is a documentary that reimagines the experience of Latasha Harlins. Harlins is often remembered as a 15-year-old Black girl, killed in 1991 by bullets from the store owner of a shop she frequented in South Central Los Angles, CA. To treat Harlin’s narrative, Allison approaches it through three observed methods:",The directorial methods of Sophia Nahli Allison’s A Love Song for Latasha (2021):,"Contextualization: family and friends speak about Harlin and her humanity as a playful, compassionate, and actualized person. Black children and girls are seen playing, the sun shines and smiles on their complexion, beads, and hair clips.  Time: parts of the documentary reverse, literally, narratively, and metaphorically to Harlin’s childhood, which frames her subjectivity and not her death.  Audio: Allison uses audio (voiceover) to discuss the details of Harlin’s death.  A voiceover and a visual void appear to mirror the heat-sensitive screen behind our eyes. Allison uses illustrations there, fast and imaginatively, to visualize what’s unseen and felt about the memory of Harlin’s death. The viewer is guided by a single voice to what becomes spatial.
",My Methodological Framework ,"My methodological framework specifically consults Allison’s take on Context (language and images to interpret this Deathscape) and Audio as illustrative methods for Shoe-Hangings including the audio product, Mapping Cemeteries: After Life. After Life is a 3-part, limited series audio project that discusses the team behind MC and the details behind the connections they found on the Timeline. Field recordings, which is a collection of recorded sounds unique to a field (or space), and audio journals are used to facilitate episode two, “Our Deathscapes.” What would’ve ordinarily occurred in-studio for the vocal aspects transpired asynchronously and with the fields of MC’s Deathscapes in mind to create an embodied audio experience akin to what is heard and felt in Allison’s example. Audio and remote recording is particularly relevant at a time of global a/synchronicity brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Sound is also crucial to the ethics of documenting the Shoe-Hanging Deathscape, which is discussed in the aforementioned episode.

The ways in which Beloved materializes is critical to understanding the sense of belonging mentioned because it is how she may actualize herself.

Like Beloved, it matters how we materialize experience as humans beings, and this is key to contextualizing Shoe-Hangings for what it represents in the category of death.",,"In another example, if one were to think literal, they might remember idioms about ‘walking in one’s shoes’ and what that could mean about the bodies metaphorically connected to them in terms of experience. Ellen Sampson, a material culture researcher, anthropologically understands shoes as “records of lived experience” for what they could indicate about the wearers being (personalization, play) or existence (occupation, social roles). What remembers us in death, as this data point asks, often points to what we use or was used to instantiate our lived experience. Shoe-Hangings in the context of death memorializes the wearer.
