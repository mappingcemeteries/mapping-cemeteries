The first governmental acts to take place on the Commons were executions, likely starting in 1691 (with the hanging and decapitation of a father and son-in-law). The site was chosen as it was on the outskirts of town and so away from people. It is also very near the African Burial Ground and was therefore convenient to bury executed slaves. The executionary structures were originally temporary—constructed and taken down as approved by the Commons Council.",Justice_Statue_Gravatar.png,Park,Infrastructure,Hangings,Punishment,,"Sometime in the 1720s these structures became more permanent, as shown by meeting notes from the Commons Council in 1728 granting approval to build a powder magazine on the Commons near the gallows. It's interesting to think that these structures both represent death and that their more permanent existence in the space is confirmed and explained in reference to one another in the records.",,,,

The seat of power built upon a space so preoccupied with punishing bodies; this inheritance seems more than symbolic. I have visited the park various times since moving to New York City 13 years ago. What struck me most on my visit for this project was how little I had paid attention before. Everything I thought I had “discovered” about the area was all laid out in a massive ground plaque near the south entrance. The public executions, the jails, that City Hall and Tweed Courthouse occupy the places where the First and Second Almshouses stood, respectively. All of it.",Justice_Statue_Gravatar.png,Park,Reflections,Reinterred,Hidden,,"The plaque is a large circle of dark stone, with different segments representing different historical eras, from Dutch settlement to 1999—the date of a major renovation to the park. The plaque strikes me as something that was a much better idea on paper than it is in reality. The surface is very slick and must be very hazardous to walk over in inclement weather. In addition, it is just not very easy to read. The large segment sizes and the curved lines already make the text hard to read; that the engraved letters and maps are filled with dirt, pigeon droppings, and other debris makes them that much harder to read. I spent the better part of 20 minutes trying to get through it all. It is both too much text and not enough. The period covered is too long for a plaque to provide any depth to the historical eras. And the particularly troubling aspects of the space have been carefully assigned to the Dutch (public executions) and British (starvation and execution of American prisoners of war). The inheritance is acknowledged, but only at a surface level (quite literally).",,,,

I experienced many complicated feelings. It is a beautiful building, made all the more picturesque by the magnolia trees in full bloom. But the police were ever-present, and there are barricades all around City Hall, keeping everyone from getting very close—the seat of government barricaded from the very people it represents. (It seems like these have been left up since last summer during the George Floyd protests and subsequent short-lived Occupy City Hall movement demanding the city defund the police.)",Justice_Statue_Gravatar.png,Park,Reflections,Reinterred,Hidden,,"Despite knowing which corner of the park held the cemetery marker I was here to visit, it took me a while to find it. It is technically part of the park, but it is outside the nicely manicured and ornately fenced part of the park, in a shabbier, small grassy area on Centre Street near Chambers Street. This marker is also light on details. These “fragmentary remains” were disturbed and reinterred here as the result of a 2010 renovation of the area, which has me wondering how many bodies were disturbed and disregarded in earlier renovations and construction projects in the space. And the complete remains discovered during renovations aren't even marked or recognized in the park in anyway. Executed bodies, poor bodies, starved bodies, incarcerated bodies—bodies treated as a burden to the State in both life and death. Remembered, but not really.",,,,
