New York Marble Cemetery vaults wall,Nadia,"The New York Marble Cemetery was created in response to the yellow fever outbreak that started near the Trinity Church cemetery. The Common Council ruled to ban earth graves in lower Manhattan to limit the spread of the Caribbean-born disease. Instead, marble vaults were built ten feet underground. Names from the original vault owners are engraved on marble tablets that are set into the stone cemetery walls. These tablets act as a guide for the location of the vaults underground. In order to access a vault, a stone slab has to be exposed by digging by hand, that is then lifted off to expose the entry shaft going down to the slate doors. Some of the vaults also require a key to open the door.",Color photo of a wall of vaults in the New York Marble Cemetery,Image,Vertical Timeline,,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/new-york-marble-cemetery,,Atlas Obscura,https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzL2VjOTc2MjNjLWQ5YTQtNDA3YS1iMmEyLThkZTM3OTY5YThiNzFhYjQwMGRjYmVmYjE5NGUzNl9OWV9NYXJibGVfQ2VtZXRlcnlfd2FsbF93aXRoX3ZhdWx0X3RhYmxldHNfMi5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjEyMDB4PiJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcXVhbGl0eSA4MSAtYXV0by1vcmllbnQiXV0/NY_Marble_Cemetery_wall_with_vault_tablets_2.jpg,,,1831,,,,Historical,,,,1823,1832,,2
